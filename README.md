# Monte Carlo Options Pricing
This project is a Monte Carlo simulation for options pricing, implemented in Python.

## Introduction
I am trying to learn stuff about finance and I thought this would be interesting to mess around with. Also streamlit is beautiful and I 
recommend it for any math/data projects.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. pip install requirements.txt
3. streamlit run option_pricing.py
4. Enter fully manual values or pick an existing stock

## Results
After running the Monte Carlo simulation, the script will output the estimated option price along with any additional relevant statistics or visualizations. 

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome, the more the marrier!
